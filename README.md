- Hello, I'm @hattori-sat.
- I majored in mechanical engineering and minored in informatics.
- During my graduate studies, I worked on satellite development for about three years.
- One of the projects I was involved in was the tethered satellite STARS-X , where I was engaged in both hardware and software aspects.
- I have a broad interest ranging from hardware to software, so I would be grateful if you could follow me.
